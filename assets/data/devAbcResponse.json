    "educationalSummary": "Your explanatory style is largely temporary and specific, which is helpful — it keeps the problem confined to this situation and moment. However, the personal focus (“I am confused”) can increase frustration by making it feel like a personal shortcoming. A more optimistic style would keep the situation framed as a temporary learning curve, attribute difficulty to factors like unfamiliar tools or missing examples, and note concrete progress so the challenge feels solvable.",

    "evidenceAgainstBelief": [
      "Everyone learning a new technology experiences confusion at first; it's a normal step in skill development.",
      "You likely have solved related problems before, so you already have learning strategies to draw on.",
      "Some obstacles may be due to unclear docs, bugs, or complexity of the task rather than a fixed inability to learn."
    ],
    "alternativeExplanations": [
      "This task uses unfamiliar tools or libraries that have a steep learning curve.",
      "The instructions or examples available are incomplete or unclear.",
      "You're tired, distracted, or trying to tackle too much at once instead of breaking it into smaller steps."
    ],
    "usefulnessReflection": "Holding the belief 'I'm confused and having a difficult time' can be useful short-term because it honestly describes your experience and can prompt you to slow down. But if you stay stuck in that label it tends to lower motivation and blocks problem-solving. A more useful stance is to acknowledge the confusion while also naming specific obstacles and next steps to make progress.",
    "alternativeBelief": "I'm struggling with parts of this project right now, but this is a normal learning phase — I can make progress by breaking the problem into smaller steps, using examples, and asking for help when needed.",
    "encouragement": "You can get unstuck: try isolating one small feature to finish, look for a simple tutorial or example that matches that piece, and celebrate that small win to build momentum.",

  "disputationScaffold": {
    "exampleEvidenceFor": "I couldn't get the login feature to work after several attempts and I felt lost reading the library docs, so it makes sense I feel confused.",
    "exampleEvidenceAgainst": "Earlier I successfully implemented a different feature (or debugged a tricky bug), which shows I can learn and solve problems. The current confusion may come from unclear documentation or an unfamiliar API rather than from being incapable.",
    "exampleAlternatives": "Maybe the library has poor examples, or I tried to learn too many things at once. If I focus on one small piece and find a tutorial or ask a question, I’ll likely make progress quickly.",
    "exampleUsefulness": "Saying 'I'm confused' helps me notice I need a different approach, but staying with that belief doesn't help me move forward. A more useful view is: 'I'm in a learning curve and will improve with one small, focused step.'"
