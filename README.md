## Development Journal

### 2025-09-28
- Added base UI screens under (tabs): entries, feeds, settings, dev
- Created AdapterProvider (React Context) for database access
- Created EntriesService to wrap adapter with business logic
- Wrote service-level tests for:
  - list
  - create
  - update
  - remove


### 2025-09-23
- Add comprehensive tests for `entriesAdapter` (CRUD + timestamps + dirtySince)
- Implement `entriesAdapter.sqlite` against Expo SQLite (named params, COALESCE, soft delete)
- Run SQLite tests via `expo-sqlite-mock` (Jest transform allowlist + setup)
- Refactor tests to use backend factories (memory + sqlite)
- âœ… Unit + integration tests passing

### 2025-09-11
- Defined `Entry` model and `EntriesAdapter` interface.
- Added stub in-memory implementation (`SQLEntriesAdapter`) for contract testing.
- Wrote first tests: 
  - add & retrieve entries
  - mark as deleted
- Learned: contract-based testing ensures I can later swap SQLite in without breaking tests.

### 2025-09-10
- Set up Expo + Jest + TS project structure.
- Added initial folders (`db/`, `api/`, `store/`, `services/`).
- Established goal: write tests first, then implement features.

## Next Steps
- UI: simple list + detail editor (add/edit/delete) wired to adapter
- State: keep Zustand store IO-free (call adapter in actions)
- Error UX: surface DB failures (toast) and optimistic updates with rollback
- E2E: verify DB works outside Jest with on-device test or manual checklist
